# Architecture guardrails

Status: P2 implementation record, 2026-07-28.

AKTREADER has one inference Reader and no hosted-model abstraction:

```text
user-supplied scan/crop + explicit target
    -> target and privacy preflight
    -> resumable batch/checkpoint layer
    -> pinned local llama.cpp CLI + open-weights VLM
    -> immutable local Reader label

two blind subscription-session label files (out of band)
    -> strict LabelIngest
    -> field-level consensus
    -> cross-act validators
    -> graded act evidence + review queue

gold acts + clerk-year holdout + predictions
    -> SerockBench evaluation report
```

The application never calls a subscription assistant, hosted model, inference API, or localhost
model server. It has no API key configuration. The subscription assistants participate only by
producing JSON files in their own sessions; those files cross a validation boundary before they
can influence evidence. Model acquisition is also outside runtime: inference accepts only
explicit local paths whose contents match recorded SHA-256 pins.

## Evidence model

The authoritative model is not a flat register row. It has four layers:

1. **Source artifact** — a content-addressed scan, page, or crop, with path, checksum, register
   identity, pixel coordinates, explicit act target, clerk-year, and privacy decision.
2. **Reader observation** — immutable output from one blind pass, including reader identity and
   family, prompt/model identity, timestamp, transcript, and spatial spans. One Reader may emit
   `PROBABLE`, `UNCLEAR`, or a typed non-present state, but never `CONFIDENT`.
3. **Act assertion** — a normalized value plus original script, observation state, confidence
   grade, alternatives, source spans, contributing Reader labels, and validator findings.
   People here are role-bearing mentions within an act, not globally resolved people.
4. **Derived hypothesis** — a corpus-level claim such as “these two mentions may be the same
   person.” It carries supporting and contradicting act IDs, a score, method provenance, and
   human review status. It never rewrites source observations or act assertions.

This separation permits corpus-level constraint solving and town graphs without laundering a
later inference into what the document was originally observed to say.

## Confidence and observation semantics

Every evidence field retains:

- `value`: normalized value when supported;
- `original_script`: literal reading in document order;
- `confidence`: `CONFIDENT`, `PROBABLE`, `UNCLEAR`, or null for a non-present state;
- `observation_state`: `PRESENT`, `ABSENT_ON_FORM`, `BLANK`, `STATED_UNKNOWN`, or `ILLEGIBLE`;
- `source_spans`: one or more scan bounding boxes;
- `alternatives`: explicit readings represented by `[unclear: X/Y]`;
- Reader and validator provenance explaining any confidence ceiling.

Presence and confidence are orthogonal. A cleanly visible blank can be reliably `BLANK`; an
expected field defeated by the pixels is `ILLEGIBLE`; a field the document formula does not
supply is `ABSENT_ON_FORM`; and a clerk's written “unknown” is `STATED_UNKNOWN`. None means
“unknown person,” and missing Reader output is not converted to any of these states.

The confidence path is deliberately asymmetric:

1. A single Reader is capped at `PROBABLE` or `UNCLEAR`.
2. Strict field agreement between distinct blind Reader families can become
   `CONFIDENT_ELIGIBLE` only when prompt, artifact, blind-group, clerk-year, and original-script
   bindings are verified.
3. Any value, state, alternatives, or literal-script disagreement becomes `[unclear: X/Y]`.
4. Cross-act validators may flag, downgrade, or support an eligibility decision. Agreement is
   never treated as truth by itself.
5. Calibration is scored against human-verified holdouts, not against consensus.

The act schema covers type/number/year, registration and event dates, town, principal, parents
including the mother's maiden name, spouse and spouse's parents, declarants and witnesses
including ages and occupations, officiant, signatures, marginalia, survivors, and
marriage-specific banns, permissions, and rabbi fields.

Normalized dates are validated independently of their literal-script evidence. The
[`date-convert`](date-validation.md) utility uses exact Julian/Gregorian civil-day conversion;
the validator flags malformed confident date values, impossible dual-calendar pairs, and a
registration that predates its event without rewriting any field.

## Local Reader boundary

`LocalReader` invokes a checksum-pinned `llama-cli` executable with explicit model, multimodal
projector, prompt, schema, image, and optional LoRA paths. It uses `shell=False`, deterministic
generation settings, and a credential-free allow-listed subprocess environment. URL/UNC
locators, auto-download flags, remote schema references, missing files, and checksum mismatches
fail closed.

The default hardware profile is revision-pinned Qwen3.5-9B Q5_K_M with an F16 projector on the
development RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB. A 24 GB quality profile uses Qwen3.6-27B Q4; Qwen3.5-4B is the
smaller fallback. These choices remain provisional until the historical-handwriting baseline
runs. The owner-cleared llama.cpp executable is verified as 10167 (`ee3d1b54c`), exit 0, SHA-256
`5719892edd89da2ce31d2b9f5f9c53c0cf244ec92294792a7f59e150e6e9aca5`. The model/projector
pair is locked by revision and checksum; after the owner fetch, the 24-job baseline executed
under the pinned `llama-mtmd-cli` frontend as recorded in the
[P2 local baseline addendum](p2-baseline-addendum.md).
AKTREADER made no operating-system security change.

## Resumable batch state machine

One batch run owns one SQLite checkpoint database. Transactions use WAL and full synchronous
durability. Each job is in exactly one state:

`PENDING`, `RUNNING`, `SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED`, `INTERRUPTED`, `REVIEW_REQUIRED`, or
`PRIVACY_REFUSED`.

The job fingerprint covers scan bytes, crop/target, act metadata, model, prompt, schema,
decoding configuration, privacy policy, and output path. A matching successful job is skipped on
resume only while its promised output remains a readable JSON object; missing or corrupt output
is requeued. A changed material input invalidates that success. Stale running work becomes
interruptible/retryable, bounded failures retain diagnostics, and JSON output is flushed then
atomically replaced. Unknown or multi-act targets go to review; the batch layer never infers a
crop or act number from a filename.

Privacy preflight is fail-closed: births require 100 years; marriages and deaths require 80 by
default. Unknown years are refused, and unknown/unsupported act types require human review.

## Training and evaluation separation

Consent and correctness are separate gates. A human-verified correction is not training data
unless its correction consent explicitly says so. The 36 P1 records have no recorded correction
consent and are evaluation-only.

The label factory has a separate `SILVER` tier for 2-of-3 machine consensus. Silver is
training-eligible but never evaluation data and never described as human-verified. The current
silver manifest content-addresses the resolved coordinator appendices and all contributing label
files; canonical training rows are not claimed until those field payloads are materialized.
Identity-level forks stay untiered and quarantined until the sampled human check.

Evaluation splits are by clerk-year, not random act. `gold/clerk_year_holdout.json` sequesters all
36 current gold records across 21 clerk-years and explicitly forbids training overlap. The eval
harness rejects a mismatched holdout manifest or any training clerk-year leakage before scoring.
Only 17 records currently bind to checksum-verified local scans; the other 19 remain explicit
`NOT_LOCALIZED` coverage gaps. The first runnable manifest therefore contains 17 jobs and cannot
claim 36/36 input coverage. This prevents missing artifacts—or a model that memorized one
clerk's hand—from masquerading as a general reader.

## Stable identity and graph horizon

- Act IDs derive from collection/register/page/act identity, not a person's name.
- Artifact checksums detect silent scan replacement.
- Reader labels are immutable; corrections append provenance rather than rewriting history.
- Normalized names never overwrite literal readings.
- CSV is a lossy search projection; evidence JSON remains authoritative.
- Corpus regrading creates a derived assessment and preserves the original per-act grade.
- Entity resolution may propose links but may not merge people without human review.

Memorial matching remains outside the extraction store. It accepts only manually entered details
and the user's own extracted corpus; it never fetches, bulk-ingests, trains on, or submits
memorial-institution records.

## Phase boundaries

- P1 is complete: 36 source-backed, evaluation-only records.
- P2 implementation gate is accepted; the first LocalReader baseline has been executed and
  measured as a weak research-derived before-picture (see the
  [P2 local baseline addendum](p2-baseline-addendum.md)). Publication-grade, image-attested
  benchmarking remains open.
- P3 acquisition and Pułtusk batch work remain blocked until the explicit terms and polite-pace
  gate is approved.
- P4 adds variant proposals without changing literal names. Raw Daitch–Mokotoff keys, the
  source-attributed [`variant-propose`](variant-key.md) layer, and schema-valid CSV batch
  processing now ship; stored batches can be schema-checked and exactly regenerated with
  `variant-batch-verify`. Explicit `RULED_OUT` evidence outranks similarity in both interactive
  and batch use. Broader attributable relation coverage and transliteration expansion remain
  open.
- P5 settles the publication surface. The license half is already decided and in
  force: MIT for code, CC BY 4.0 for original transcriptions and derived records.
