# Human adjudication packets

`aktreader-lab adjudicate` turns the residue left by reading and verification into a small,
self-contained question set. It does not ask a human to transcribe a register. A question can
use a same-hand **letterform choice** (a disputed glyph plus 3–6 uncontested examples of each
candidate) or **visual corroboration** (a field crop beside repeated occurrences and independent
index rows). Both modes show a plain-language claim, available anchors and structural checks,
and the consequence of every choice.

Its input is normally a consensus record produced by
[`consensus-merge`](consensus-merge.md); the fields that command escalates as
arbitration requests are what this one turns into questions.

## Build a packet

`human_check/` is owner-local and gitignored — packets embed source-pixel crops
and named human answers, so they are never distributed. On a clean clone
`adjudicate` exits 2 against the absent wave specification, naming the path it
wanted; that is the intended fail-closed behavior, not a defect.

Prepare `human_check/waves/wave-003.json` under
`schemas/adjudication-wave-1.0.0.schema.json`, then run:

```powershell
aktreader-lab adjudicate --wave 003
```

Use `--spec` or `--output-dir` for an explicitly different local path. The generator verifies
every image SHA-256 before opening it, cuts the source-pixel span and explicitly boxed disputed
glyph locally with Pillow, magnifies both with nearest-neighbor resampling, and embeds every PNG
as a data URI. The HTML has no
network dependency. If an exemplar has a precise `glyph_bbox`, it is used. Otherwise the miner
requires `character_index`, makes a visibly disclosed proportional character crop, and keeps
the full word beside it.

### Visual corroboration

Set `review_mode` to `VISUAL_CORROBORATION` and provide one or more pinned
`comparison_evidence` regions, such as the closing-formula repeat and annual-index row. The mode
shows complete word-shape crops and deliberately skips same-hand exemplar mining. A candidate
with `effect: ROUTE_EXPERT` is treated like neither/can't-tell: it emits expert-review and tier
events but no attestation. Set `benchmark_eligible: false` and `correction_eligible: false` when
a non-reader is checking consistency rather than independently reading the script; that records
useful human evidence without silently promoting it to benchmark gold or training data.

Question selection is deterministic:

1. identity forks;
2. machine deadlocks;
3. ink/corroboration conflicts;
4. single-coverage fields on gold nominees.

The nominal cap is ten. Identity forks and deadlocks are mandatory and may exceed it.
`EXCLUDE_TRANSCRIPTION_QUEUE` items are never selected. For each **letterform-choice** candidate,
generation fails closed unless it can mine at least three uncontested instances of the proposed
glyph from the same clerk-year; it selects at most six.

## Record and ingest answers

Open `packet.html` locally. “Neither / something else” and “Can’t tell” are first-class answers,
not failures. The page downloads an answers JSON; it never submits data.

```powershell
aktreader-lab adjudicate --wave 003 `
  --answers .\human_check\generated\wave-003\adjudication-wave-003.answers.json
```

Ingestion verifies the packet and question fingerprints, requires exactly one answer per
question, and writes an immutable content-addressed result directory containing:

- verbatim answers, coordinator interpretation, and the declared consequence;
- tier-action events;
- per-field gold-attestation events;
- consent-gated correction-flywheel JSONL;
- an expert-review list for neither/can't-tell outcomes.

It never edits a reader label, silver record, or gold record. A downstream review must apply
the emitted event. Correction reuse is training-eligible only when the answer file records
explicit `GRANTED` consent.

## Honest limits

A non-reader matching letterforms is discriminating among proposals, not independently reading
the script. Both candidates can be wrong, so every question includes the neither escape.
Publication-grade gold should still be sampled by a reader of the script. The packet raises the
evidentiary floor and focuses expert time; it does not replace expertise.
